# raspi_buster_sdk
This is a docker project for development of software for the RaspberryPi with Buster image.

This project was inspired by https://github.com/Pro/raspi-toolchain so all credits go to Stefan Profanter!

I want to be able to build my RaspberryPi projects in automated GitHub actions to have CI/CD implemented.
